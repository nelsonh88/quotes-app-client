<h1>MotivationQ</h1>

<h2>Description:</br></h2>
MotivationQ is a application based on building a community to help its users get and stay motivated throughout their daily grind as they reach their goals! Users can store their favorite quotes that help them stay motivated throughout the day and also do the essential CRUD actions on their quote resources. The deployed site can be found at https://nelsonh88.github.io/quotes-app-client/ , enjoy!

<h2>How To Use:</br></h2>
- A user must sign up to get full access to the CRUD actions on their quote resource, if they already have an</br> account they can sign in with their credentials.</br>
- Onced signed in, a user can CRUD on their quotes resource.</br>
- Onced signed in users can see other user's quotes with their names being displayed.</br>
- Users can also add other user's quotes into their quotes list.</br>
- Users can change password and sign out.</br>

<h2>List of Technologies Used:</br></h2>
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- AJAX
- A Rails API that I built
- Handlebars
- SASS/CSS
- HTML

<h2>Process:</br></h2>
- First made a wireframe ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/DiGpmd5.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")</br>

- Worked on authentication first and made sure that the actions worked.</br>
- I then basically made a CRUD machine for the quotes resource.</br>
- Tested all actions and made sure they worked.</br>
- Then worked on Handlebars to display quotes on views.</br>
- Then styled authentication and CRUD on quotes.</br>
- For version control I used github and committed everyday a few times a day.</br>

<h2>Unsolved Problems/Future Iterations:</br></h2>
- Unsolved problems would like to notify the user once logged in when they can see other users' names and their quotes that when that user has yet to submit a quote, some type of notification saying no quotes.</br>
- Also want to prepopulate the update field so a user doesn't have to retype the quote and only change whatever part they want to update in that quote.</br>
- For future additions I want to add a 3rd party API called Twilio where a user will need to input their phone number to get daily quotes from their list.</br>
- I want to work on some more styling to give the user a better experience.</br>
- I want to add a feature where users can have other users as friends and when a user clicks on their name it will take them to their persanalized profile.
- Unsolved problem is when a user has no quotes there is no notifcation of when a user has no quotes
- I want to implement a search bar so signed insers can search for other users
